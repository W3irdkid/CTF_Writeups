- This room is guided, so we simply need to answer several questions step by step.

- First, I run [[nmap]] scan

- There is an HTTP server on port 80, so I checked it and found an interesting note in the source code
![](images/BasicPentesting2.png)
- Now I ran a gobuster scan to reveal hidden content
- It found an interesting directory in combination with the note from the source code

Because I saw information about SMB being configured (this information was also included in the nmap scan I ran earlier) in one note, and weak credentials in another, I'm about to run an enumeration scan from a Metasploit module

Looking at the enumeration results, I could see that there was an anonymous user account, so I tried to log in to it with smbclient

![](images/BasicPentesting8.png)
It worked, and I could see a text file that I couldn't read, but I was able to download it
![](images/BasicPentesting9.png)
From that i can suppose there were  at least two users  - kay and jan
So now I will try to bruteforce jan's SSH credentials with [[Hydra]] because from the previous note, I know he has weak credentials

![](images/BasicPentesting10.png)
- Successfully obtained the complete credentials
	- username: jay
	- pass: armando

- Also, I found a pass.bak file in kay's home folder, but couldn't access it either
![](images/BasicPentesting12.png)

- As I didn't seem to have any useful privileges, I decided to run linpeas.sh

- It seems I missed an important one
![](images/BasicPentesting13.png)

![](images/BasicPentesting14.png)
- It looks like I have read privileges for the private key
- So I copied the content of this file and saved it on my machine
![](images/BasicPentesting15.png)
- Then, I converted the downloaded key to a format understandable for John, and ran John to decrypt it, which gave me a password
- While I tried to connect via SSH with the gained password and the id_rsa file, I encountered a problem
![](images/BasicPentesting16.png) 
- This was quick to solve, as all I had to do was change the permissions on the file 
- After a successful login as kay, the rest was just a formality
